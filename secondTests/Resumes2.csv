BFAM Partners (Hong Kong) Limited, Hong Kong
Finance Officer
BFAM Partners is a multi-strategy hedge fund with AUM of around $2.3bn, it allocates capital dynamically amongst three core investment strategies: Equity-Linked trading strategies including convertible bonds; Volatility trading strategies focused on regional Equity and FX markets; and Credit trading strategies.
Since I joined BFAM Partners in August 2016 and reporting directly to the COO, I brought the Cayman, Hong Kong and Consolidated management accounts, which were outsourced to an accountancy firm back in house, the responsibilities included selecting an accounting software, setting up all the necessary controls and processes, writing up the Finance Manual. The process has helped to speed up the reporting timeline and to improve the accuracy of the accounts.
In addition to producing the monthly management accounts for the corporate entities, I am responsible for all the day to day running of the accounts including bookkeeping, making payments to third parties including the payroll firm. I also carry out Corporate Treasury function managing liquidity between the entities.
Further, I have set up a model to examine our tax position potentially restructuring Transfer Pricing model as the business grows.
Aside from the Corporate entities, my responsibilities for the Cayman based investment fund are as below:
 As part of the routine NAV production cycle, I work closely with the Middle Office team and the Administrator in Mumbai to ensure the P&L is correct, and ensure capital movements and expenses are accounted for correctly and that the allocation between the investors are correct. I am responsible for issuing estimated performance to investors on a weekly basis.
 Ensuring compliance and tax filings are completed such as K1s for the US investors and FAR for CIMA.
 As the Finance Officer, I attend board calls from Cayman and answer directors’ queries. Attend investors due diligence meetings to represent Finance.
As for the annual Audit on both Corporate and the Fund, I am very much involved reviewing the statutory accounts under IFRS, liaising with the Auditors and Administrators to get the accounts audited and signed off.

 Maintaining relationship with Data Provider – Thomson Reuters, ongoing monitoring and negotiation of cost
 Oversee the administration of the UCITS fund
I am currently leading a project to switch AIFMD Depositary provider.
